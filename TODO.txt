---+ General TODOs

* change module_transparent to meta_predicate
* change user: to system: (in progress)

---+ Proposed Reorganization

The organization and distribution of the code is due for an
overhaul. See http://blipkit.wordpress.com for announcements

One of the goals is to make the individual modules more independent

* Rename all .pro files to .pl
* simplify directory structure, package/blip/X/ --> X/
* move from svn to github
* merge phylo/ and homol/
* merge curation/ and ontol/
** separate project for each package? use git submodules
* move sql/sql_schema/X to appropriate package; e.g. schema_enscompara to phylo/
* test directory for each package
* move test files to individual packages
* separate distros for non-bio stuff
